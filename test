    19. A software development team uses git for version control and docker as a container tool for the application. Describe briefly how you would implement continuous integration in qa, staging and production for the releases.
       QA-we have jenkins container for intergeting  the flow of the CI and CD 
        checkout  the souce code to jenkins container volume and build the souce code using  corresponding build tool which is in jenkinscontainer  then will push to build repo( Ex:Jfrog repo) and using ansible we push to qa  env (Qa containers )
        Staging -qa team will promate the build tp Staging env and deploying the build to   staging by ansible tool
        Production- we got approval from release manager and promate build to prod env using kubernets         
          We can use tag based deployment based on the dev environments.
20.In the Bash script, write a program that calculates the total disk size and total memory that exists on the machine. The output of your program should match exactly what is below (with the dashed lines in the output):
#!/bin/bash
TD=`df -h .| awk -F " " '{print $2}' |tail -1`
FREE=`(free -m | tail -2 | head -1 | awk -F " " '{print $2}')`
echo "------"
echo "Total Disk:${TD}"
echo "Total Memory:${FREE}MB"
